This directory contains all the files needed to test the scenario with.
The Topology directory contains the python script that runs Mininet with
the topology depicted in the paper. The Netkat folder contains the two
netkat python files that are used prior to and after the reconfiguration
of the network.

There are two sets of the NetKAT code (one written in python and the
other written in the surface syntax). The surface syntax policies caused
a BadPreReq when testing with Mininet, so testing was done using the
python implementations.

Prereqs: Mininet, Frenetic, and PCNC

Running the Mininet topology: python PCNC_Scenario.py <controller ip> <controller port>

Running the Python Configuration:
    frenetic http-controller --openflow-port <controller port>
    python InitialConfig.py
    python Reconfig.py

Running the Surface Syntax:
    frenetic openflow13 --openflow-port <controller port> --policy-file InitialConfig.kat
    frenetic openflow13 --openflow-port <controller port> --policy-file Reconfig.kat
